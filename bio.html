  <p>My name is Jaiven Smith, I’ve lived in Lexington, Kentucky for my entire life. I currently attend the University of Kentucky as a major in Integrated Strategic Communication with a minor in Digital Studies. I also work part-time as a Technical Specialist at Apple Store Fayette Mall. In my free time, I enjoy practicing photography and digital art in photoshop.</p>

  <p>My friends would call me a “man of many hats”. I’ve studied web design, photography, presentation skills, and graphic design since my sophomore year in high school. Learning these skills at a younger age has helped me to network with those in the local Lexington community and taught me the importance of polishing my professional appearance.</p>
    
  <p>Through learning to polish my appearances, I’ve learned to creatively do the same for my clients. Check out my works page for some examples of my work.</p>
    
  <p>I look forward to working together soon!</p>
